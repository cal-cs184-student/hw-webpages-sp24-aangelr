	<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
	<p>In our project, we convert an SVG file containing 2D characters into 3D models. We extract the structure of the characters using Bezier curves
		and then triangulate them to create mesh representations of the characters. The mesh triangles are then extracted into 3D dimensions using
		external libraries.
	</p>
	<!--<p>Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. Each <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. You might find this useful for framing and showing your result images in an organized fashion.</p>-->
	<div align="middle">
		<table style="width=100%">
			<tr>
				<td>
					<img src="images/Q.jpg" align="middle" width="500px"/>
					<figcaption align="middle"> Example of 3D rendered text

	<h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
	<p>
		Our project aims to enhance digital typography by leveraging GPU acceleration rendering of high-quality 3D text from 2D fonts created
		through Bezier curves. There are 2 major challenges that our project will tackle:
		<ol>
			<li>Efficiently parsing and triangulating Bezier curves on the GPU</li>
			<li>Transforming the 2D text into a 3D model without losing details or creating artifacts</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
	<p>
		Our final deliverable will be a 3D rendering of characters with path tracing for realistic shadows.
		Our 3D rendering of text will either be laying down on the ground or on a wall in which the user can interact
		with the environment like in homework 4 (zoom, change perspective). We aim to explore the effectiveness and
		efficiency of GPU-based rendering techniques for converting 2D text into 3D models. Specifically, we're
		investigating whether leveraging GPU acceleration can significantly improve the rendering speed and quality
		of 3D text compared to traditional CPU-based methods. This includes assessing the impact on realism and visual
		appeal when advanced rendering techniques like texturing and ray tracing are applied to 3D text models
		generated from Bezier curves. We are trying to discover if GPU rendered text from 2D to 3D is better
		(has less artifacts, is faster) than the CPU version of it. We believe that at a minimum, we must deliver
		generation of the 2D text using Bezier curves and the GPU and make it 3D. Our team would ideally like to
		have 2 different implementations of 2D to 3D text rendering, one that utilizes CPU and the other which
		utilizes GPU. Additionally our team would like to apply properties into the 3D rendering such as texture
		mapping or pathtracing.
