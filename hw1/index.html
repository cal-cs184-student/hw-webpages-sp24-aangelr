	<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
	<p>This assignement required us to implement a rasterizer that can take SVG files as input and display a rasterized representation of that image.
		This project included supersampling, transformations, color interpolation using barycentric coordinates and various methods of texture mapping
		via various pixel sampling methods and mipmap level sampling methods. I found the whole project interesting as a whole and seeing the process to
		display images on a raster was very satisfying. The mipmap level sampling methods in particular were very involved and satisfying to understand
		because of the intuition behind sampling from different resolutions to reduce aliasing.
	</p>

	<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

	<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
	<p>
		I looped over all pixels in the raster and checked if the middle points of the pixel are inside the triangle bounded by the 3 input coordinates.
		If they are, I fill the pixel with the given color. This algorithm terminates early if the given pixel sample is not within the triangle,
		so it is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.

	</div>

	<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

	<p> I updated rasterize_triangle in order to implement supersampling. I had to calculate the intermediate points of the pixel
		based on the sample rate instead of only sampling at the middle point. I then wrote those results of the supersampled
		pixels to a super sized sample buffer. After the sampling was done, I averaged the supersamples within a pixel and
		then drew that color to the pixel in the frame buffer. Supersampling allowed us to reduce aliasing by
		letting us achieve intermediate colors where the triangle partially falls within the region of the pixel.
		This reduces jaggies and also floating pixels that arent attached to the rest of the triangle. Because of the supersampling,
		there are more sample points that are being bounded by the triangle, which allows the shape of the triangle to be displayed
		more effectively.

	<p>Barycentric coordinates are a method to find an interpolated value of coordinates
		using weighted values of 3 vertex values. The alpha, beta, and gamma values dictate the coefficient of sampling
		color values from the 3 vertices of the triangle.

	<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
	<p> Pixel sampling is a way to know what texture to apply to the raster when the sample point's texture coordinate
		is not located at a discrete texel in texture space. There are two methods to do pixel sampling. One is nearest pixel,
		which finds the nearest texel to our texture coordinate and uses the color located there. The other method is
		bilinear pixel interpolation, which gets the 4 texels that surround our uv coordinate in texture space and
		linearly interpolates the color value based on the color values and distances to the 4 texels, similar
		to barycentric coordinate color interpolation.

	</div>
	<p>The quality increases when switching from nearest neighbor to bilinear sampling.
		Bilinear is able to reduce high frequencies. Sharper color changes get blurred out more which somewhat
		reduces aliasing.
	</p>
	<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
	<p>Level sampling allows us to sample from a more appropriate texture resolution in order to reduce aliasing and computation.
		For nearest level, I looked at the texels corresponding to pixel differences of x+1 and y+1 and computed the maximum distance.
		This distance implies how much texture is squeezed into that pixel. The higher the amount of texture, the higher mipmap level we use.
		Bilinear allows us to compute mipmaps at continuous levels, which allows for smoother transitions between textures.
		Using nearest is faster and preserves the sharpness of the image which bilinear smoothens out textures more but is more computationally
		expensive. Supersampling also increase computation cost.
